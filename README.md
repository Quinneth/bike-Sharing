## Project Overview
Analyize the August, 2018 NYC bike-sharing dataset and create set of visualizations for a similar project in Des Moines. The visualizations were then used to create a business proposal in Tableau. 

## Resources
Data Source: 201908-citibike-tripdata
Software: Tableau, Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas

## Analysis
One of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. <br>

### Deliverable 1:
The dataset needed preparation upfront. Using Pandas, "tripduration" column datatype was changed from an integer to datetime. 

### Deliverable 2:
Using Tableau, we created visualizations that show:<br>
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week <br>
